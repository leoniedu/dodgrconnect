\title{Connect Disjoint Components in a Graph}
\usage{
connect_components(
  graph,
  distance_threshold = 20,
  connection_type,
  wt_profile,
  wt_profile_file = NULL,
  surface,
  n_components = Inf
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A graph object with spatial coordinates}

\item{distance_threshold}{Distance threshold in meters to connect components.}

\item{connection_type}{Type of new edges (e.g., "footway", "cycleway")}

\item{wt_profile}{Weighting profile to use (e.g., "foot", "bicycle")}

\item{wt_profile_file}{Path to profile file. If NULL, uses default profiles}

\item{surface}{Surface type for new connections (e.g., "paved", "asphalt")}

\item{n_components}{Maximum number of components to connect. Default Inf connects all}
}
\value{
Updated graph with new edges connecting components
}
\description{
This function connects disjoint components of a graph by adding edges between
vertices that are within a specified distance threshold. Components are processed
in order of size (largest first), and each component is connected to the
previously connected network.
}
\examples{
graph <- dodgr::weight_streetnet(dodgr::hampi)
graph_connected <- connect_components(
    graph,
    distance_threshold = 200,
    connection_type = "footway",
    wt_profile = "foot",
    surface = "paved"
)
