\usage{
connect_components_simple(
  graph,
  distance_threshold = 20,
  connection_type,
  wt_profile,
  wt_profile_file = NULL,
  components_to_join
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A data frame or dodgr_streetnet object containing the graph}

\item{distance_threshold}{Maximum distance in meters to consider for connecting vertices}

\item{connection_type}{Type of way to use for connecting components (e.g., "path", "footway")}

\item{wt_profile}{Weight profile to use for calculating edge weights and times}

\item{wt_profile_file}{Optional path to a custom weight profile file}

\item{components_to_join}{Integer vector of length 2 specifying the two component IDs to connect}
}
\value{
A modified graph with the specified components connected. If components are
successfully connected, their component IDs are updated to match the first component.
If connection is not possible within the distance threshold, the graph remains unchanged.
}
\description{
This function connects two components of a graph by adding edges between
vertices that are within a specified distance threshold. It identifies the
closest vertices between components and creates bidirectional edges to connect them.
}
\details{
The function uses spatial indexing and sf package for efficient distance calculations
between vertices. New edges inherit properties from the weight profile specified.

The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Validates inputs and checks if the connection_type exists in the weight profile
\item For each vertex in the second component, finds the closest vertex in the first component
\item If any pair of vertices are within distance_threshold, creates bidirectional edges
\item New edges are created with proper weights and times using dodgr's internal functions
\item Updates component IDs to reflect the new connection
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
library(dodgr)
# Load a street network
net <- weight_streetnet(hampi)

# Connect components 1 and 2 with footway edges
net_connected <- connect_components_simple(
  graph = net,
  distance_threshold = 50,  # 50 meters
  connection_type = "footway",
  wt_profile = "foot",
  components_to_join = c(1, 2)
)
